# Hangman Game with react and typescript
Hangman is a perfect beginner React project since it is easy enough logic-wise, but still includes many complicated problems to solve. I have created this project to teach React and Typescript.

## Instructions on Running the Project
This project uses Create Vite TS.

## Instructions on Running Project
1. Clone this repo and cd to project root directory
2. Install required npm packages - `npm i`
3. Run the vite dev server - `npm run dev`

This will lunch your next.js application at port 3000 in your local machine. Browse [http://localhost:3000]([http://localhost:3000]) to view the application.
